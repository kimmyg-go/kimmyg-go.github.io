      <h2>My E-Portfolio Journey</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my professional e-portfolio‚Äîa curated showcase of my growth, projects, and reflections throughout the <strong>Communication Skills for Leaders (COMSKIL K32)</strong> course. This space reflects not only what I've learned but <strong>how I‚Äôve evolved</strong> as a communicator, team player, and emerging business leader.</p>
      <p>From crafting compelling video pitches to leading strategic marketing plans, every assignment has sharpened my ability to think critically, collaborate effectively, and communicate with clarity and purpose.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        üéØ <strong>Goal:</strong> To present a compelling narrative of my academic and professional development‚Äîproving that I am ready to contribute meaningfully to any dynamic team or entrepreneurial venture.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: SELF-INTRODUCTION VIDEO -->
    <section>
      <h3>üé• Self-Introduction Video</h3>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Create a 1‚Äì2 minute video pitch introducing yourself at a networking event, showcasing your personal brand and value proposition.</p>

      <div class="video-container">

      <div class="submission-box">
        <strong>My Submission:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="A3.pdf" class="file-link" download>A3.pdf</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In my reflection, I identified three areas for improvement:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Gesture Synchronization:</strong> My hand movements didn‚Äôt match emotional statements.</li>
            <li><strong>Paralinguistics:</strong> My tone was flat, especially during transitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal-Nonverbal Alignment:</strong> Eye contact and camera framing were inconsistent.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feedback-box">
        <strong>Feedback from Instructor:</strong>
        <p>"You seem to have a clear idea of what you want to communicate, which is a great start. Now, you just need to work on delivering your message more smoothly. Consistent practice will definitely help improve your confidence and flow."</p>
        <p>"Be mindful of your camera angle‚Äîthe lens was positioned a bit low, which affected the overall framing."</p>
        <p>"There were no supporting photos or video clips to back up your claims, such as being timely or skilled. Including concrete evidence would make your message more convincing."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>I now practice with a tripod at eye level and record multiple takes to improve delivery. I use Canva to create mini-visuals for future presentations. I‚Äôve also started using vocal warm-ups to vary pitch and pace, making my delivery more dynamic and natural.</p>
        <p>This experience taught me that a strong message needs both content and presentation. I aim to include visual proof of my skills in future pitches to build credibility.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: A2 - INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION -->
    <section>
      <h3>üìù A2: Individual Reflection on Communication Breakdown</h3>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Reflect on a communication experience using Grice‚Äôs Maxims and the 8 C‚Äôs of communication.</p>

      <div class="submission-box">
        <strong>My Submission:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="QUIZ 2 individual.pdf" class="file-link" download>QUIZ 2 individual.pdf</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I reflected on a group project where I assumed shared understanding of APA formatting. I violated the maxim of <em>Quantity</em> by omitting key details and <em>Manner</em> by using vague terms like ‚Äústandard academic formatting,‚Äù causing confusion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feedback-box">
        <strong>Feedback from Instructor:</strong>
        <p>"The opening paragraph lacks clarity and detail. Be specific: When did this happen? What kind of project was it? What was the research report about?"</p>
        <p>"You mentioned 'it was my intention' ‚Äî clarify why. What motivated it? Also, smooth out transitions between ideas. Jumping from deadlines to citation styles without connection confuses the reader."</p>
        <p>"Who is 'the person'? A classmate? Professor? And when you say 'the group saw the error' ‚Äî who exactly? Why did it cause frustration and delays? Just because of citation style? Not clear."</p>
        <p>"Adding these details will make your narrative more coherent and relatable."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>This feedback was eye-opening. I realized that even honest reflection needs structure and specificity. I‚Äôve since learned to use the <strong>S.T.A.R. method</strong> (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to keep narratives clear and impactful.</p>
        <p>I now ask myself: <em>Who was involved? When did it happen? What exactly went wrong? What did I learn?</em> This has made my writing more credible and easier to follow.</p>
        <p>Going forward, I‚Äôll ensure every communication is complete, clear, and context-rich to prevent misunderstandings.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: QUIZ 1 INDIVIDUAL - GROUP CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS -->
    <section>
      <h3>üîç Quiz 1 Individual: Group Contribution Analysis</h3>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Analyze how each member applied business principles (e.g., 4 Ps, DICEE) in the Panaderia Delight project.</p>

      <div class="submission-box">
        <strong>My Submission:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="Quiz 1 individual.pdf" class="file-link" download>Quiz 1 individual.pdf</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I analyzed how each team member used concepts like the 4 Ps, DICEE principle, and stakeholder theory in our strategy. For example, I applied DICEE (Deep, Intelligent, Complete, Empowering, Elegant) to community engagement by designing emotionally resonant collaborations with student orgs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feedback-box">
        <strong>Feedback from Instructor:</strong>
        <p>"AS ALWAYS EMPHASIZED IN OUR CLASS - THE BALANCE OF SOFT AND HARD SKILLS."</p>
        <p>"I am not asking for a collective assessment. Highlighting individual contributions shows the application of our lessons."</p>
        <p>"Your work doesn‚Äôt include an analysis of how each member applied the business principles. Adding this helps show your growth as a group and as individuals."</p>
        <p>"Taking time to do this helps show your growth as a group and as individuals, and reminds us that learning becomes more meaningful when we connect it to real experiences and teamwork."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>This feedback taught me that teamwork isn‚Äôt just about collaboration‚Äîit‚Äôs about accountability and visibility. I now make it a point to document not just what we did, but how each person applied course concepts.</p>
        <p>In future group work, I‚Äôll lead the team in writing contribution analyses that highlight both soft skills (leadership, adaptability) and hard skills (strategy, execution).</p>
        <p>This makes our learning visible and turns group projects into powerful evidence of applied knowledge.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: QUIZ 1 GROUP TASK - INITIAL & FINAL SUBMISSION -->
    <section>
      <h3>üçû Group Project: Panaderia Delight Revival Plan</h3>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Develop a sustainable, low-cost marketing strategy using the 4 Ps, DICEE principle, and community engagement.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Our initial submission focused on basic strategies like logo design and packaging. After feedback, we resubmitted a revised plan with detailed execution plans, timelines, responsibilities, and projected ROI (e.g., 25% sales increase).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feedback-box">
        <strong>Feedback on Initial Submission:</strong>
        <p>"I appreciate that your group mentioned the 4Ps of Marketing ‚Äî it's a strong foundation. However, the overall output still feels too generic. Strategies like logo design and packaging are quite common and expected."</p>
        <p>"What's missing are critical business details: How will each strategy be executed? Who is responsible? When? What are the projected expenses and expected ROI?"</p>
        <p>"Remember: in business strategy planning, it‚Äôs not just about ideas ‚Äî it‚Äôs about showing how they work in real-life scenarios."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>This feedback was a turning point. I realized that creativity without execution is just an idea. After the critique, I led my team in revising the plan to include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear ownership (e.g., I handled community engagement)</li>
          <li>Timelines and internal deadlines</li>
          <li>Budget estimates and projected ROI (25% sales increase)</li>
          <li>Mock-ups and real-world applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We shifted from a generic plan to a <strong>convincing, investor-ready strategy</strong>. This taught me that true innovation lies in details, responsibility, and sustainability.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: DATA COMMENTARIES & BUSINESS THEORIES -->
    <section class="no-feedback">
      <h3>üìä Data Commentaries & Business Theories</h3>
      <p><strong>Task:</strong> Analyze non-prose forms (NPFs) and write data commentaries using PIER (Prediction, Implication, Expectation, Recommendation). Apply business principles like 4 Ps and Stakeholder Theory.</p>

      <div class="submission-box">
        <strong>My Submissions:</strong>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Individual Task:</strong> I analyzed a blog post about SK-II‚Äôs brand evolution, focusing on its shift from a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù product to science-driven branding. Using the PIER structure, I interpreted how SK-II leveraged Ansoff‚Äôs Product Development Strategy to innovate and differentiate in the luxury skincare market.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Task:</strong> Our group researched Filipino skincare entrepreneurs like Rosmar Tan (Rosmar Kagayaku) and Glenda Vito (Brilliant Skin Essentials). We created NPFs (charts, infographics) on sales trends, social media growth, and customer engagement, then wrote data commentaries using the 4 Ps and Stakeholder Theory.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>The SK-II analysis taught me that strong brands evolve with consumer needs. By shifting to scientific research (e.g., Akita Study), SK-II applied <strong>Ansoff‚Äôs Product Development Strategy</strong> to maintain a competitive edge.</p>
        <p>In our group project, we saw how local entrepreneurs like Rosmar Tan used influencer marketing and community trust to grow rapidly. We applied the <strong>4 Ps</strong> and <strong>Stakeholder Theory</strong> to recommend sustainable growth strategies, such as expanding to physical stores and enhancing CSR initiatives.</p>
        <p>Using the <strong>PIER framework</strong> helped me structure insights logically: What does the data predict? What should we expect? What should we do? This made my commentaries more impactful and actionable.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>My cover letter applies for a Marketing Assistant role at China Bank Philippines, highlighting my experience in strategic content creation, campaign execution, and data-informed marketing. I used <em>pathos</em> to express passion, <em>ethos</em> to establish credibility, and <em>logos</em> to showcase measurable impact.</p>
        <p>My resume emphasizes leadership in the Creatives Committee of Spectra, digital marketing skills, multilingual communication, and academic honors.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <strong>My Reflection:</strong>
        <p>Creating these documents helped me articulate my value proposition clearly. I learned to move beyond listing skills and instead tell a story of impact.</p>
        <p>I now tailor every application to the job description, using keywords and aligning my experiences with the company‚Äôs goals. This makes my application more relevant and persuasive.</p>
        <p>Even without feedback, this process built my confidence in self-presentation ‚Äî a critical skill for any business professional.</p>
